# crawl_finanical_reports
Simple tool to crawl Financial Reports and compare them. The blog post associated with this project can be found [here](https://tuananhbui89.github.io/projects/project_crawling_financial_reports/).

To start crawling simply run `python 01_crawl_financial_reports.py`. The script will crawl the financial reports of all companies listed in the 'asx-listed-companies.csv' file. The output will be saved in the 'asx' folder.

To compare the financial reports of selected companies, modify the file '02_compare_financial_reports.py' and run it. The output will be saved in the 'compare' folder.
